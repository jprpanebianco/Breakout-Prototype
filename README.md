# Breakout Clone with Jumping - [Play it.](https://jprpanebianco.github.io/breakout.html)
This is a little prototype I made. One of my first prototypes actually. It's a clone of [breakout](https://elgoog.im/breakout/). 

Traditionally, the game-space is vertical, like in the example above, but with borders on the sides. I thought it would make more sense to utilize all of the screen-space on today's widescreen monitors, so I made it play horizontally. The camera follows the paddle a little bit, as it moves up and down, which I think makes the gameplay feel a bit smoother.

If you've played breakout before, you probably know it's pretty boring, especially towards then end of a stage. When the last few blocks are remaining, it can be a hassle to hit them. This prototype doesn't resolve that. You can change the ball's direction based on where it hits the paddle, but it would be nice to let the player arc the ball while its bouncing around. This would probably by achieved with the mouse cursor. I would also like to make an ability that just lets the ball hone in on the cursor, exactly where it is placed.

But the main gimmick of the game is to make the ball jump. It can hop over blocks with a mouse click. This way it can do a bunch of damage while you collect the powerups. I also decided to include a ground pound the ball can perfrom while jumping. Another mouse click. The ground pound destroys multiple balls at once.

After playing the game again, I will probably return to it soon and add some abilities and multiple stages. I think exploding blocks would be fun. Multiple balls. Homing balls. Blocks that can only be destroyed with a ground pound, or from behind. Basically, make the game about destoying all the blocks as quickly as possible.
